## Objectives and Functions of the Catalogue ##

The catalogue should be an effective and efficient instrument that enables a user:

  * 4.1. to **find** bibliographic resources in a collection as the result of a search using attributes or relationships of the resources:
    * 4.1.1. to **find** a single resource
    * 4.1.2. to **find** sets of resources representing
      * all resources belonging to the same work
      * all resources embodying the same expression
      * all resources exemplifying the same manifestation
      * all resources associated with a given person, family, or corporate body
      * all resources on a given subject
      * all resources defined by other criteria (language, place of publication, publication date, content type, carrier type, etc.), usually as a secondary limiting of a search result;

  * 4.2. to **identify** a bibliographic resource or agent (that is, to confirm that the described entity corresponds to the entity sought or to distinguish between two or more entities with similar characteristics);

  * 4.3. to **select** a bibliographic resource that is appropriate to the user’s needs (that is, to choose a resource that meets the user’s requirements with respect to medium, content, carrier, etc., or to reject a resource as being inappropriate to the user’s needs);

  * 4.4. to **acquire** or **obtain** access to an item described (that is, to provide information that will enable the user to acquire an item through purchase, loan, etc., or to access an item electronically through an online connection to a remote source); or to access, acquire, or obtain authority data or bibliographic data;

  * 4.5. to **navigate** within a catalogue and beyond (that is, through the logical arrangement of bibliographic and authority data and presentation of clear ways to move about, including presentation of relationships among works, expressions, manifestations, items, persons, families, corporate bodies, concepts, objects, events, and places).
