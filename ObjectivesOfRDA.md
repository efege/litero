    * 0.4.2 Objectives
      * 0.4.2.1 Responsiveness to User Needs

The data should enable the user to:
  * _find_ resources that correspond to the user’s stated search criteria;
  * _find_ all resources that embody a particular work or a particular expression of that work;
  * _find_ all resources associated with a particular person, family, or corporate body;
  * _find_ all resources on a given subject;
  * _find_ works, expressions, manifestations, and items that are related to those retrieved in response to the user’s search;
  * _find_ persons, families, and corporate bodies that correspond to the user’s stated search criteria;
  * _identify_ the resource described (i.e., confirm that the resource described corresponds to the resource sought, or distinguish between two or more resources with the same or similar characteristics);
  * _identify_ the person, family, or corporate body represented by the data (i.e., confirm that the entity described corresponds to the entity sought, or distinguish between two or more entities with the same or similar names, etc.);
  * _select_ a resource that is appropriate to the user’s requirements with respect to the physical characteristics of the carrier and the formatting and coding of information stored on the carrier;
  * _select_ a resource appropriate to the user’s requirements with respect to form, intended audience, language, etc.;
  * _obtain_ a resource (i.e., acquire a resource through purchase, loan, etc., or access a resource electronically through an online connection to a remote computer);
  * _understand_ the relationship between two or more entities;
  * _understand_ the relationship between the entity described and a name by which that entity is known (e.g., a different language form of the name);
  * _understand_ why a particular name or title, or form of name or title, has been chosen as the preferred name or title for the entity.

(The list of objectives goes on, and then comes the list of principles.)
